Event tracking
==============
MolView tracks a number of events like changing the model representation using
Google Analytics in order to analyze the usage and popularity of all features
included in MolView. We can use this information to find out which features are
used more and might deserve more development. Usage statics are stored by Google
and are believed to be anonymous. Google will not share this data with
third parties unless any of the exceptions in part 6 of the Google Analytics
Terms of Service (http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) is in effect.

You can enable and disable event tracking by reloading MolView and un-checking
"Allow MolView to collect interaction data"
